    "- Effective when the dataset is large, has many features, has many redundancies in data, and the from of the gradient is a sum.\n",
    "- More commonly, instead of randomly selecting one data, the program can select a small subset of data (called a `minibatch`) for each step. This method gives more stable estimation and is faster.\n",
    "- Stochastic gradient descent in general has lower testing error because of less overfit\n",
